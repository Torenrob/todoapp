# To-Do App

I would like this to be a very impressive application for beginner or not. Must remember I have yet to learn react so I shouldn't get too far ahead of myself. But I don't want to limit myself either.

This app will have:

- [ ] Projects
  - [ ] will have title, description, tags/labels, due dates/times, priority rank, and completion % bar based on task completion within project.
  - [ ] ability to edit, update, delete
  - [ ] will contain user/teams assigned to project
  - [ ] will contain task list under project
        &nbsp;
- [ ] Tasks
  - [ ] will have title, description, tags/labels, due dates/times, priority rank, and completion check box.
  - [ ] ability to update, edit, delete
  - [ ] task dependency system available to user
  - [ ] will contain user/teams assigned to task
  - [ ] subtask functionality for breaking down large tasks
        &nbsp;
- [ ] Global Functionality
  - [ ] Ability to setup recurring tasks inside/outside of projects
  - [ ] Search and filtering for projects/tasks
  - [ ] Themes
  - [ ] Reminders/Notifications
  - [ ] sorting of projects/tasks by title, tags/labels, due dates/times, priority rank, and completion
        &nbsp;
- [ ] Over My Head Functionality ==but not impossible==
  - [ ] calendar integration or its own calendar gui
  - [ ]
